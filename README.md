### üìö What I learned

One of the most interesting things I learned during this challenge was how to customize radio buttons to make them look more modern and interactive. Instead of styling the `input` itself, I focused on styling the `label` to give it a button-like appearance. This technique improves the overall user experience, making the rating buttons more visually appealing and intuitive.

```html
<div class="rate-btn">
  <input type="radio" name="rating" class="radio" id="1" value="1" />
  <label for="1" class="radio-container">1</label>
</div>
```
```css
input[type="radio"] {
    opacity: 0;
    position: absolute;
    pointer-events: none;
}

label {
    width: 2.625rem;
    height: 2.625rem;
    background-color: var(--dark-blue);
    border-radius: 50%;
    padding-top: 2px;

    font-weight: 700;
    line-height: 1.5rem;

    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}

input[type="radio"]:checked + label{
    background-color: var(--orange);
    color: var(--dark-blue);
}
```

### üí° Continued development

Although I learned a lot about customizing radio inputs, there's still so much to explore in form customization. I'm excited to continue improving my CSS skills to create more interactive and accessible forms in future projects.

### üìñ Useful resources

- [MDN: Input radio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) - This helped me to comprehend `input radio` a bit better.
- [W3Schools: How to customize checkboxes](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_custom_checkbox.asp ) - This is great reference on how to customize inputs.
